## 🔍 What Causes a Recession?

A recession occurs when **economic activity slows down significantly** for an extended period. The reasons can vary, but some common causes include:

- **High inflation:** When prices rise too quickly, reducing purchasing power.
- **High interest rates:** Borrowing becomes expensive, slowing business growth and consumer spending.
- **Reduced consumer confidence:** People stop spending due to fear of job loss or uncertain future.
- **Global crises:** Events like COVID-19 or wars can disrupt supply chains and demand.
- **Tight monetary policies:** When central banks reduce money supply to fight inflation, it can backfire.
- **Asset bubbles bursting:** Like the housing crash of 2008.

All these factors can lead to a **decline in demand, production, investment, and jobs**, pushing an economy into recession.

## 📉 How is a Recession Measured?

A country is considered to be in recession when its **GDP contracts for two consecutive quarters** (i.e., 6 months). But GDP alone isn’t enough — several other indicators show us the broader impact.

## ✅ 7 Key Indicators of a Recession – With Real-World Examples

---

### 📉 **1. GDP Growth Rate – Two consecutive quarters of negative growth**

**What it means:**  
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services produced. A consistent decline reflects falling demand.

**Example:**  
- Q1 GDP: ₹150 lakh crore  
- Q2 GDP: ₹145 lakh crore → -3.3%  
- Q3 GDP: ₹140 lakh crore → -3.4%  
➡️ Two back-to-back negative quarters = Recession confirmed

### 💼 **2. Unemployment Rate – A sudden spike**

**What it means:**  
As companies struggle with losses, hiring freezes and layoffs become common.

**Example:**  
During a slowdown, IT firms like Infosys or Wipro lay off thousands.  
India's unemployment rate rises from 6% to 9%.

---

### 🏭 **3. Industrial Output – Sharp decline in production**

**What it means:**  
Factories reduce output due to low demand. Sectors like manufacturing, mining, and electricity are hit hard.

**Example:**  
Car sales decline → Maruti and Hyundai reduce factory shifts → Industrial output drops.

---

### 📊 **4. Stock Market – Sustained fall**

**What it means:**  
Markets are forward-looking. A consistent drop in stock prices signals fear and low investor confidence.

**Example:**  
Sensex and Nifty drop by over 10% in 3 months during COVID or geopolitical tensions.  
➡️ Panic selling, bearish sentiment.

---

### 🛍️ **5. Retail Sales – Downward trend in consumer spending**

**What it means:**  
Consumers cut back on non-essential purchases — luxury goods, gadgets, and vacations.

**Example:**  
Amazon and Flipkart report 20% lower festive season sales.  
Shopping malls see a sharp drop in foot traffic.

---

### 📉 **6. Consumer Confidence Index – Decline in trust and optimism**

**What it means:**  
This index tracks how confident people feel about their income and job stability. A drop means fear.

**Example:**  
If the index falls below 100 (say 68), it indicates anxiety about spending and saving behavior.

---

### 🏦 **7. Bank Loan Growth – People avoid taking loans**

**What it means:**  
During uncertainty, people and businesses hesitate to borrow, reducing investments in homes, equipment, or business expansion.

**Example:**  
SBI and ICICI Bank report a 30% fall in personal loan and business loan applications.
