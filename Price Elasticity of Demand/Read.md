# Plastic Elasticity Demand (PED)

## Introduction
Plastic Elasticity Demand (PED) is a concept that explains how demand for a product **changes in a flexible way** when the price changes. Unlike normal price elasticity, which assumes a fixed response to price changes, plastic elasticity considers **real-life factors** like customer habits, brand loyalty, competitor actions, and seasonal effects.

## Understanding Elasticity in Demand (With Simple Examples)
**Elasticity of demand** measures how much people **change their buying habits** when the price of a product changes. The formula is:

\[
PED = \frac{\% \text{Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\% \text{Change in Price}}
\]

### Examples:
- **Elastic Demand (PED > 1)**: Suppose the price of ice cream increases by **10%**, and as a result, sales drop by **20%**. Here, demand is **elastic** because people easily switch to alternatives like soft drinks.
- **Inelastic Demand (PED < 1)**: If the price of petrol rises by **10%**, but people still buy nearly the same amount (say, only a **3% drop**), the demand is **inelastic** because there are fewer alternatives.
- **Unitary Elasticity (PED = 1)**: If a **10% price increase** leads to a **10% drop in demand**, demand is **unitary elastic**, meaning the total revenue remains the same.

## What Makes Demand 'Plastic'?
Plastic elasticity means demand is **not fixed** and **adapts over time** based on different influences, such as:
- **Consumer Adaptability** – People slowly change habits. If movie ticket prices rise, at first, they still go to theaters, but over time, they may switch to OTT platforms.
- **Competitive Effects** – If Pepsi increases its price, demand may drop as people switch to Coca-Cola.
- **Market Saturation** – In a city with many coffee shops, a small price change at one shop may not affect demand much.
- **Brand Loyalty** – Apple users may still buy iPhones even if prices rise, showing less plasticity.
- **Economic & Psychological Factors** – During inflation, consumers may avoid non-essential products regardless of price.

## Factors Affecting Plastic Elasticity Demand
1. **Product Type** – Basic needs like salt have low plasticity, while luxury goods like smartwatches have higher plasticity.
2. **Consumer Awareness** – If people know about cheaper alternatives, they switch easily, making demand more elastic.
3. **Substitutes Availability** – If substitutes exist (e.g., butter vs. margarine), demand becomes more flexible.
4. **Price Sensitivity** – Price-conscious buyers react more to price changes, making demand more plastic.
5. **Seasonality** – Demand for air conditioners is higher in summer, so price changes affect sales more in peak seasons.
6. **Marketing & Promotions** – Discounts temporarily increase demand, showing short-term elasticity.

## PED in Business and Pricing Strategy
Understanding PED helps businesses in:
- **Revenue Optimization** – Finding the best price to maximize profits.
- **Competitive Pricing** – Adjusting prices based on competitors' moves.
- **Demand Forecasting** – Predicting how price changes affect future sales.
- **Inventory Management** – Stocking products based on expected demand shifts.
- **Dynamic Pricing** – Using AI-driven pricing that changes based on real-time demand (e.g., Uber’s surge pricing).

## Conclusion
Plastic Elasticity Demand (PED) gives businesses a **realistic view** of how demand changes due to price adjustments. It is more flexible than traditional price elasticity and considers real-world factors like competition, branding, and customer habits. Using data science, companies can analyze PED to **set the right prices, forecast demand, and maximize revenue**.
