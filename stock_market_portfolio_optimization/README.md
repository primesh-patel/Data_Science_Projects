# 📈 Stock Market Portfolio Optimization  

Welcome to the **Stock Market Portfolio Optimization** project! 🚀  
This project focuses on optimizing a stock portfolio to achieve maximum returns while minimizing risks using modern financial theories and algorithms.  

---

## 📋 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to help investors:  
- **Identify optimal portfolios** by balancing risk and return.  
- **Maximize returns** through efficient allocation of investments.  
- **Minimize risks** using mathematical models and statistical analysis.  

Key components of the project include:  
1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock price data is fetched using the `yfinance` Python library.  
2. **Risk Analysis**: Calculating metrics like standard deviation and covariance.  
3. **Portfolio Optimization**: Using techniques such as:  
   - Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)  
   - Sharpe Ratio Maximization  
   - Monte Carlo Simulations
