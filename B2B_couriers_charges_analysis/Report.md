# B2B Courier Charge Analysis Report

## Project Overview
The "B2B Courier Charge Analysis" project focuses on analyzing courier charge discrepancies in business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The goal is to identify instances where ABC has been correctly charged, overcharged, or undercharged for courier services. This analysis helps in detecting billing inconsistencies and ensuring accurate financial reporting.

## Data Summary
The dataset contains information on total orders categorized by charge type, along with the corresponding count and amount in INR.

### Charge Type Breakdown
| Description                                      | Count | Amount (Rs.) |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------|
| Total Orders where ABC has been correctly charged | 12    | 507.6       |
| Total Orders where ABC has been overcharged     | 382   | 33750.5     |
| Total Orders where ABC has been undercharged    | 7     | -165.2      |

### Key Findings
- **Overcharged Orders**: The majority of orders (95.3%) fall under this category, leading to an excess payment of Rs. 33,750.5.
- **Correctly Charged Orders**: Only 3% of the orders were charged correctly.
- **Undercharged Orders**: A small portion (1.7%) of the orders were undercharged, resulting in a revenue loss of Rs. 165.2.

## Visualization
The pie chart provided visually represents the proportion of orders in each charge type, emphasizing the significant percentage of overcharged transactions.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals a major issue with overcharging in ABC's B2B courier transactions. It is crucial to address these discrepancies by reviewing the invoicing system and ensuring accurate billing practices. Steps should be taken to minimize errors and negotiate better pricing agreements with courier service providers.

## Recommendations
1. **Audit Courier Charges**: Conduct a detailed review of courier invoices to identify and rectify overcharges.
2. **Implement Automated Verification**: Develop an automated system to cross-check charges against agreed-upon rates.
